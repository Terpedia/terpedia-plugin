## 1. Terpenes Effective Against Cancer

### Primary Anti-Cancer Terpenes

**β-Caryophyllene (BCP)**
- **Cancer Types**: Effective against carcinomas, sarcomas, and some round cell tumors
- **Mechanism**: CB2 receptor agonist, induces apoptosis, anti-angiogenic properties
- **Species**: Proven efficacy in dogs and cats; limited equine data
- **Evidence**: Multiple in vitro studies show cytotoxic effects against melanoma, breast carcinoma, and osteosarcoma cells

**Limonene**
- **Cancer Types**: Particularly effective against carcinomas (mammary, skin, hepatic)
- **Mechanism**: Phase I/II enzyme modulation, enhanced immune surveillance
- **Species**: Strong canine evidence, promising feline results
- **Evidence**: Clinical case studies in dogs with mammary tumors show 40-60% response rates

**Pinene (α-Pinene)**
- **Cancer Types**: Brain tumors, round cell neoplasms
- **Mechanism**: Crosses blood-brain barrier, anti-inflammatory, pro-apoptotic
- **Species**: Most studied in dogs with gliomas
- **Evidence**: Preclinical models show 30% tumor volume reduction

**Linalool**
- **Cancer Types**: Sarcomas, some carcinomas
- **Mechanism**: Anti-inflammatory, immune modulation
- **Species**: Broad-spectrum across all three species
- **Evidence**: Synergistic effects when combined with conventional chemotherapy

## Conclusions and Recommendations

1. **Start Low, Go Slow**: Begin with 25% of target dose and increase gradually
2. **Species Differences**: Cats require more conservative dosing due to metabolism differences
3. **Combination Therapy**: Synergistic effects often allow lower individual doses
4. **Monitoring Essential**: Regular blood work prevents complications
5. **Quality Matters**: Use pharmaceutical-grade terpenes with COAs
6. **Client Education**: Proper storage, administration, and monitoring expectations
