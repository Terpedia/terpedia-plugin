## Database Tables

The system creates a `terpedia_rss_comments` table to track:
- Agent ID
- RSS item hash (unique identifier)
- Item title and link
- Generated post ID
- Creation timestamp

## Cron Jobs

- **Daily Check**: `terpedia_daily_rss_check` runs daily to process all agent feeds
- **Individual Processing**: `terpedia_agent_feed_process` processes individual agents with random delays

## AJAX Endpoints

- `test_agent_rss_feed`: Test feed connection and keyword matching
- `trigger_agent_feed_update`: Manually trigger post generation
- `get_agent_feed_stats`: Get detailed feed statistics

## Troubleshooting

### No RSS Items Showing
- Check if feeds are configured in agent profile
- Verify feed URLs are accessible
- Ensure keywords are set and match content

### Posts Not Generating
- Check if OpenRouter handler is available
- Verify agent has `terpedia_agent_type` meta set
- Check WordPress error logs for issues

### Comment Tracking Not Working
- Ensure `terpedia_rss_comments` table exists
- Check if posts are being created successfully
- Verify RSS item hashing is working correctly

## Customization

Edit the `setup_default_feeds_for_agent()` method in `agent-rss-feed-manager.php` to add new agent types and their default feeds.

### Modifying Keyword Matching
Update the `item_matches_keywords()` method to change how keywords are matched against RSS content.
